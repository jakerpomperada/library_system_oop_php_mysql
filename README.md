## 📌 About This Project  
This is a **Simple Library System** built using **PHP and MySQL** with an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach** and styled with **Bootstrap** for a modern and responsive design. The system allows users to **add, edit, delete, and search for books** in a library database.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books  
✔ **Live Search with AJAX** (Search by Title, Author, or Year)  
✔ **Bootstrap UI** for a clean and responsive layout  
✔ **OOP-based PHP Code** for maintainability and scalability  
✔ **Delete Confirmation Modal** using Bootstrap  
✔ **Secure Input Handling** to prevent SQL Injection
